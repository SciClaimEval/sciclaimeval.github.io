Welcome to **SciClaimEval**, a pilot task on the **verification of scientific claims against tables and figures** from scientific articles.
The task is organized as part of [NTCIR-19](https://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/ntcir-19/) and aims to evaluate systems that can reliably check the truthfulness of scientific statements using **multi-modal evidence**.

Scientific claim verification involves determining whether claims made in research papers are supported or refuted by accompanying evidence, such as experimental results, tables, and figures.  
With the rapid rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs), the volume of scientific submissions has increased substantially, creating a growing demand for tools that can assist reviewers in assessing the validity and consistency of paper claims.

The **SciClaimEval** pilot task focuses on **cross-modal scientific claim verification**, aiming to assess whether textual claims in scientific papers are adequately supported by evidence from diverse modalities, namely **tables and figures**.  
We introduce a new benchmark dataset, constructed by extracting claims and their corresponding evidence from scientific articles across multiple domains, including **biomedicine, machine learning, and natural language processing**.
